This is the Ledger technology blog.


Ledger believes in security and transparency.
Most of our software and hardware development are open source.

Have a look to our [GitHub](https://github.com/ledgerhq)

Pull requests are welcome :)

If you're a developper and would like to write app on Nano S or Nano X, have a look to the [Documentation](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
